from https://harddrop.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline:
~~    Playfield is 10 cells wide and at least 22 cells tall, where rows above 20 are hidden or obstructed by the field frame~~
~~    Tetromino colors~~
        ~~Cyan I~~
        ~~Yellow O~~
        ~~Purple T~~
        ~~Green S~~
        ~~Red Z~~
        ~~Blue J~~
        ~~Orange L~~
    ~~Tetromino start locations~~
        ~~The I and O spawn in the middle columns~~
        ~~The rest spawn in the left-middle columns~~
        ~~The tetrominoes spawn horizontally with J, L and T spawning flat-side first.~~
    Super Rotation System/Standard Rotation System (SRS) specifies tetromino rotation
    Standard mappings for console and handheld gamepads:
        Up, Down, Left, Right on joystick perform locking hard drop, non-locking soft drop (except first frame locking in some games), left shift, and right shift respectively.
        Left fire button rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise, and right fire button rotates 90 degrees clockwise.
    Standard mappings different from console/handheld gamepads for computer keyboards
    ~~So-called Random Generator (also called "random bag" or "7 system")~~
    "Hold piece": The player can press a button to send the falling tetromino to the hold box, and any tetromino that had been in the hold box moves to the top of the screen and begins falling. Hold cannot be used again until after the piece locks down. Games on platforms with fewer than eight usable buttons (such as the version on iPod) may skip this feature. The combination of hold piece and Random Generator would appear to allow the player to play forever.
    Game must have ghost piece function.
    Terms used in the user manual: "Tetriminos", as opposed to "tetrominoes", "tetrads" or "pieces"; letter names, as opposed to "square", "stick", etc.
    Designated soft drop speed. Details vary between guideline versions.
    Player may only level up by clearing lines or performing T-Spins. Required lines depends on the game.
    The game must use a variant of Roger Dean's Tetris logo, although this was true from around 2000 - before the guidelines emerged.
    Game must include a song called Korobeiniki, which is the Tetris theme song. (Guideline 2005~)
    The player tops out when a piece is spawned overlapping at least one block, or a piece locks completely above the visible portion of the playfield.
